# Clarifying your code with Comments

Your computer must be able to understand your programs. Because the computer is a dumb machine, you must be careful to spell C commends exactly right and type them in the order you want them executed. However, people also read your programs. You will change your programs often, and if you write programs for a company then companies needs will change overtime. You must ensure that your programs are understandable to people as well as computers. Therefore, you should document your programs by explaining what they do.

### Commenting in action

Hopefully you will be a master at commenting your code! Leave yourself helpful comments in your programs to help you out when you look back at your code in a while from now. It's a really great idea to get used to this habit now.
