### Introduction
iOS applications are written in Objective-C (as well as the newly introduced Swift, which we will cover later in the course when you are in Lighthouse). Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language built on top of the C programming language. We are going to learn the fundamentals of C in this section and then move on to Objective-C in the next section.

Letâ€™s write our first C program!
