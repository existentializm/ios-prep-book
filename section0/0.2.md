Xcode is the main IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that developers use to make applications for iOS, MacOS, WatchOS, and TVOS.

**Step 1:** Please make sure you have the latest release build of Xcode installed on your Mac. 

We suggest downloading Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). If you run into trouble installing Xcode via the Mac App Store you can also manually install it by going to the [developer site](https://developer.apple.com/download/). You will need to create a free developer account and log in.

Step 2: Add a dock alias to Xcode for quick access ![Xcode dock](/images/xcode-dock.png).
