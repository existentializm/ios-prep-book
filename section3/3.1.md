# Pushing to Github
---

Make sure you are in Terminal when following the steps below

#### Create a new repository
`cd` change into the directory where you saved your assignments. Hopefully in the lighthouse folder we created earlier i.e `~/Desktop/lighthouse/assignments/`

and type: `git init` to create a new git repository.

#### Add & Commit your files
You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using

*All files*
```
git add .
```

This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use

`git commit -m "Commit message"`

Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

#### Pushing changes
Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute

```
git push origin master
```

And just like that, you completed the prep work!
