#### Git & Github

**Introduction**

Every software project is managed in "Source Control". Source control helps developers keep track of their work and have multiple people easily contribute to the same project.

***Git*** is by far the most popular open source option for source control. There are many alternatives to Git, but we are going to focus on git in this course.

***Github*** is a web application that hosts our Git repositories for us and makes Git even more social and collaborative. It's super cool. In fact, many open-source projects are hosted on Github and we'll be using some during our course.

If some of it is confusing or daunting, donâ€™t worry. We'll be using Git and Github throughout the course so you'll get a knack for it over time.
